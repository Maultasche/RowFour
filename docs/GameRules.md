# Game Rules

- The game involves two players
- The game starts off with a grid. This grid can be any size, but we'll start off with 7 x 6.
- The player whose turn it is can choose a column to place their token in
- When placed in a column, the token will dropdown to the lowest cell that isn't already occupied by another token
- If a player has at least four tokens in a row at this point (diagonally, vertically, or horizontally), they win. If not, the other player gets a turn
- The turns repeat until one player wins or the grid fills up with tokens, in which case nobody wins

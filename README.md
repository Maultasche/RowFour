# Oken Row

## Overview

This is the implementation of a game for the purposes of practicing my Node.js skills, practicing using functionally-oriented Javascript, and just having fun.

## Status Summary

This project is in its very earliest phases. We're defining what it will look like and how we will implement it.

## Development Plan

Initially, this will be a simple console app where both players play using the same console and keyboard. We're starting off with simplest possible implementation. Once that's done, we'll gradually expand the features to add things like saving to a file, a game server, multiple clients, and eventually a full-featured web application.

You can take a look at the current product backlog in the product boards tab in Github.
